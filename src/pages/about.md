Hi there!
I’m Julia — a graphic designer passionate about creating charming, joyful designs for party stationery and special occasions.

Art and design have always been part of my life, and I’ve long loved celebrating life’s little moments with creativity and heart. Every piece I create is crafted with love, a hint of magic, and a whole lot of joy.

Based in Melbourne, Australia, I find daily inspiration in the world around me.
What began as a passion project for friends and family has grown into two Etsy shops where I now share my work with a wider community.

Whether I’m designing custom invitations or exploring new design trends, I’m always focused on bringing warmth, creativity, and happiness to everything I do.

Thanks for visiting my corner of the web!
